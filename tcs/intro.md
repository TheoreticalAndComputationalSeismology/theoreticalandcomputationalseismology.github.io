# Theoretical & Computational Seismology

This is a solution companion to the book "Theoretical and Computational
Seismology" by author by Jeroen Tromp, Blair Professor of Geology and Professor of Applied & Computational Mathematics.

Theoretical and Computational Seismology is available for purchase at [Princeton University
Press](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691267968/theoretical-and-computational-seismology?srsltid=AfmBOopvcYeZzfsQZXwoQYsOS42YjHRRO1JTcj5uKIG27agrDBY0z_1e).


Solutions to problems in Chapters 1-5 are static PDFs. Solutions to Chapters 6 and 7 are hosted as Jupyter notebooks. For users who want to edit the code, each 
notebook hosts the option to be opened in Binder or Google Colab. A PDF version
of all Chapter 6 and 7 solutions can also be downloaded below
